My name is Matthew Fang and I'm studying electrical engineering with a minor in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign expecting to graduate 
May 2023. I'm interested in hardware design and semiconductors. Feel free to contact me @ mfang20@illinois.edu.
  
These repositories are a collection of a few of my favorite design projects while at UIUC. While I had many lab based classes, not all of them had specific invidvidual based designing aspects as the ones included here have and I have opted not to include many of them.
